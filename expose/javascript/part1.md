* Question 4
Error, because variables declared using 'let' are only visible within the very block that it was declared in.
* Question 5
Error, because line 7 (result = num1 + num2) is trying to reassign a variable that is not allowed to be reassigned.
* Question 6
This line never got executed because an error occurred at line 7, however, this would also cause an error since the scope for a const variable is only within the block where it was declared.
