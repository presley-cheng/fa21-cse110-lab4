** Part 2
* Question 1
print the number 3, because i was declared through a var keyword in the for loop, which persists beyond blocks, and since i was incremented on every iteration of the loop plus the last time it was incremented to exit out of the loop, we get 3.
* Question 2
print the number 150, because discountedPrice was declared using a var keyword, which means it is visible within the entire 'discountPrices' function, or in other words, persists after the block it was created.
* Question 3
print the number 150, finalPrice was also declared using the var keyword at the beginning of the function, therefore, it is visible throughout the entire 'discountPrices' function.
* Question 4
